### About me

I am a Software Engineer with experience building web applications using React, Redux, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, AWS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and SQL.

I have recently finished my curriculum at APP Academy, a highly selective and immersive Software Engineering Bootcamp in San Francisco, where I spent 100 hour weeks learning and developing my skills around technologies needed in the workforce.

When I'm not coding, I find time to immerse myself in video games and learning new skills through Youtube and the internet. I've found passion in coding and I'm currently trying to learn video game development outside of the curriculum I learned from App Academy.
